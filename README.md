CHAPTER-3: CODE OF CONDUCT
This chapter specifies and helps the continued implementation of the KPPRA
operating principles by establishing certain minimum standards of behaviour in
key areas. The nature of this code is not meant to cover all possible situations
that may occur. It is designed to provide a frame of reference against which to
measure any activities. Employees should seek guidance when they are in doubt
about the proper course of action in a given situation, as it is the ultimate
responsibility of each employee to “do the right thing”, a responsibility that
cannot be delegated. Employees should always be guided by the following basic
principles:
 Avoid any conduct that could damage or risk KPPRA or its reputation;
 Act legally and honestly;
 Put the KPPRA’s interests ahead of personal or other interests.
3.1 Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations
KPPRA and its employees are bound by the law. Compliance with all applicable
laws and regulations must never be compromised. Additionally, employees shall
adhere to internal rules and regulations as they apply in a given situation. Those
internal rules are specific to the KPPRA and may go beyond what is required by
the law. Senior Management will ensure that:
All employees are aware of this Code;
No employee will be asked to do anything that would contravene this Code;
Queries and concerns arising under this Code will be dealt with properly and
may be addressed to the HRD.
KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA PUBLIC PROCUREMENT REGULATORY AUTHORITY (KPPRA) Page 16
3.2 Conflicts of Interest
Employees will always act in the best interests of KPPRA. A Conflict of Interest
occurs when personal interests of an employee or the interests of a third party
compete with the interests of KPPRA. In such a situation, it can be difficult for the
employee to act in the best interests of KPPRA. Employees shall avoid Conflicts of
Interest whenever possible. If a Conflict of Interest situation has occurred or if an
employee faces a situation that may involve or lead to a Conflict of Interest, the
employee shall disclose it to his or her Line Manager and/or the Human Resource
Department (HRD) or the Legal or Compliance Function to resolve the situation
in a fair and transparent manner.
Procedure to Disclose. The general rule is that disclosure should be made at
the time the conflict first arises, or it is recognised that a conflict might be
perceived, to the Head of Department. When in doubt, employee should always
disclose an interest in advance. If the Head of Department has an interest in the
matter to be discussed, the disclosure shall be made to the Director HR/ Admin &
Finance.
Many situations will require nothing more than a declaration of the interest
and/or activity and subsequent authorisation by the Head of Department. Some
instances will, however, need to be dealt with by agreeing how the conflict can be
managed. The approach adopted should be documented and copies provided to
the relevant parties with a copy to HR. It is the responsibility of those affected to
comply with the approach that has been agreed
Any unresolved matter shall be referred to MD. In cases of particular difficulty,
resolution may be sought through the employee grievance procedure.
3.3 Families and Relatives
Hiring and career development decisions will be fair and objective. Immediate
family members and partners of employees may be hired as employees or
consultants only if the appointment is based on qualifications, performance, skills
KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA PUBLIC PROCUREMENT REGULATORY AUTHORITY (KPPRA) Page 17
and experience and provided that there is no direct or indirect reporting
relationship between the employee and his or her relative or partner. In case of a
relative, any member of selection committee may be barred to be a part of
selection process. These principles of fair employment will apply to all aspects of
the employment, including compensation, promotions and transfers, as well as in
case that the relationship develops after the respective employee has joined the
Authority.
3.4 Equal Opportunity
KPPRA will ensure that its employment-related decisions are based on relevant
qualifications, merit, performance and other job-related factors. KPPRA will not
tolerate unlawful discrimination relating to employment. Hiring, evaluation,
promotion, training, development, discipline, compensation and termination
decisions shall be based on qualifications and merit only. KPPRA does not
discriminate on the basis of race, colour, religion, age, gender, marital status,
disability and ethnic origin.
3.5 Bribery and Corruption
Bribery occurs when someone offers, pays, seeks or accepts a payment, gift or
favour to influence an official outcome improperly. Bribery and corruption can be
direct or indirect through third parties. Employees of KPPRA:

3.6 Confidential Information
Confidential information consists of any information that is not or not yet public
information. KPPRA unless required by law or authorized by their management,
employees shall not disclose confidential information or allow such disclosure.
This obligation continues beyond the termination of employment.
Furthermore, employees must use best efforts to avoid unintentional disclosure
by applying special care when storing or transmitting confidential information.
KPPRA respects that third parties have a similar interest in protecting their
confidential information. In case that third parties, share with KPPRA
confidential information, such information shall be treated with the same care as
if it was KPPRA’s confidential information. In that same spirit, employees shall
protect confidential information that they have obtained in the course of their
prior employment.
3.7 Fraud, Protection of Authority’s Assets, Accounting
Employees must never engage in fraudulent or any other dishonest conduct
involving the property or assets or the financial reporting and accounting of
KPPRA or any third party. This may not only entail disciplinary sanctions but can
also result in criminal charges. KPPRA’s financial records are the basis for
managing the authority’s business and fulfilling its obligations to various
stakeholders. Therefore, any financial record must be accurate and in line with
KPPRA’s accounting standards. Employees shall safeguard and make proper and
efficient use of KPPRA’s property. All employees shall seek to protect KPPRA’s
property from loss, damage, misuse, theft, fraud, embezzlement and destruction.
These obligations cover both tangible and intangible assets, including
trademarks, know-how, confidential or proprietary information and information
systems. To the extent permitted under applicable law, the Authority reserves
the right to monitor and inspect how its assets are used by employees, including
inspection of all e-mail, data and files kept on Authority’s network terminals.
KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA PUBLIC PROCUREMENT REGULATORY AUTHORITY (KPPRA) Page 19
3.8 Gifts, Meals, Entertainment
Employees shall not be influenced by receiving favours nor shall they try to
improperly influence others by providing favours. Employees may only offer or
accept reasonable meals and symbolic gifts which are appropriate under the
circumstances, and they shall not accept or offer gifts, meals, or entertainment if
such behaviour could create the impression of improperly influencing the
respective business relationship. When assessing the situation in light of the
above, employees shall consult the policy applicable in their area. If no such
policy is available, they shall apply the most restrictive local practice in order to
avoid even the appearance of improper dealings. When in doubt, the employee
shall seek guidance from his or her Line Manager or the Legal or Compliance
Function. No employee shall offer to or accept from any third party gifts taking
the form of any of the following, whatever the value involved:
 Money
 Loans
 Kickbacks
 Similar Monetary Advantages.
In case any gift etc is given, the employee may immediately submit it to HR
Manager or Line Manager.
3.9 Discrimination and Harassment
KPPRA respects the personal dignity, privacy and personal rights of every
employee and is committed to maintaining a workplace free from discrimination
and harassment. Therefore, employees must not discriminate on the basis of
origin, nationality, religion, race, gender, age, political loyalty or engage in any
kind of verbal or physical harassment based on any of the above or any other
reason. Employees who feel that their workplace does not comply with the above
principles are encouraged to raise their concerns with the HRD. Employees
should be particularly sensitive to actions or behaviours that may be acceptable
KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA PUBLIC PROCUREMENT REGULATORY AUTHORITY (KPPRA) Page 20
in one culture but not in another. They should treat others with respect and
avoid situations that may be perceived as inappropriate. Harassment can result
in disciplinary action and may lead to dismissal.

CHAPTER-8: POLICY TO DEAL WITH DISCRMINATION &
HARRASSMENT POLICY
8.1 Introduction
The KPPRA does not tolerate any form of discrimination on the basis of race,
religion, gender, color, ancestry, serious medical condition, ethnicity, age, or
disability, in KPPRA employment, KPPRA operated programs, services or
facilities.
KPPRA believes that all employees are entitled to a workplace free of harassment
and expects employees to treat each other and our clients with courtesy and
respect. Conduct which violates this policy includes, but is not limited to foul
language, dirty jokes or comments pertaining to race, religion, sex, gender
identify, color, national origin, age, or disability, regardless of whether the
conduct was intended to offend or intimidate or not.
8.2 Discriminatory Practices
Discriminatory practices are prohibited in KPPRA. Following are some of the
examples of such practices:
 Sexual harassment includes: requests for sexual favors, unwelcome sexual
advances and other non-verbal, verbal or physical conduct of a sexual
nature that creates a hostile environment for persons of either gender.
 A hostile environment is a result of severe or pervasive harassment that
substantially interferes with an individual’s work performance. The
harassment must have been unwelcome and offensive to the victim and of
a nature that would be offensive to the reasonable person. The hostile
environment standard applies to harassment on the basis of race, religion,
sex, color, national origin, age, or disability. Examples of harassing
conduct include, but are not limited to:
KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA PUBLIC PROCUREMENT REGULATORY AUTHORITY (KPPRA) Page 50
 Sexual harassment: requests for sexual favors, sex oriented verbal
kidding, teasing, jokes, comments, display of sexually suggestive
objects or pictures, physical contact such as hugging, patting, or
brushing up against another’s body.
 Gender or sex harassment: gender based jokes or comments;
 Race or national origin harassment: epithets, slurs, or negative
stereotypical comments, jokes or cartoons;
 Age harassment: stray remarks or jokes relating to a person’s age.
 Disability harassment: Disparaging remarks, slurs or jokes relating
to a person’s physical or mental disability.
 Religious harassment: Coercion of employee participation in
religious activities, verbal attacks or religious slurs.
 Employment decisions based on stereotypes or assumptions about the
abilities, traits, or performance of individuals of a certain gender, race,
religion, or ethnic group, or individuals with disabilities.
 Denying employment opportunities to a person because of marriage to, or
association with, an individual of a particular race, religion, national origin,
or an individual with a disability.
 Retaliation to an employee who takes one of the following actions: filing a
complaint of discrimination, participating in a discrimination
investigation, opposing discriminatory practices. The KPPRA will not
tolerate employment-based retaliation and any violation should be
reported immediately.
Conduct prohibited by this policy is unacceptable in the workplace and in any
work-related setting outside the workplace, such as during KPPRA business trips,
KPPRA business meetings, conducting KPPRA related business and KPPRA
business-related social events.
KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA PUBLIC PROCUREMENT REGULATORY AUTHORITY (KPPRA) Page 51
If an investigation determines that discrimination, harassment or retaliation
indeed occurred, the offender would be subject to corrective action and/or
disciplinary action up to and including termination.
8.3 Procedures
An employee who feels that he/she has been a victim of discrimination, threat,
sexual harassment, harassment, bullying etc may make a complaint, without fear
of retaliation, according to the following procedures:
8.3.1 Complaint Procedures: Informal Stage
The first stage of the Complaints Procedure is an informal one, designed to
provide the opportunity of resolving as quickly as possible the problems of
bullying or harassment within the workplace prior to activating the formal
procedure. In particular, the purpose of the action is to give the bully or harasser
the opportunity to stop (if directly approached), or managers the opportunity to
resolve any problems without the employee having to use the formal procedures.
It must be noted that if an employee feels unable to take informal action, or the
situation is so serious as to warrant it inappropriate, then it is possible to go
straight to the Formal Procedure.
An employee who is subject to bullying or harassment should in the first instance
take two steps.
 Firstly record all details of any discrimination, threat, sexual harassment,
harassment, bullying i.e. date, time, nature of incident and the names of
witnesses.
 Secondly, request that the person responsible for the behaviour stops it
and makes it clear that the behaviour is unacceptable and unwanted.
It is appreciated that the second step is a difficult one and the victim may need
assistance, counseling, advice and support in order to undertake it. Such
assistance can be obtained, via the HR Manager. It is preferable for all concerned
KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA PUBLIC PROCUREMENT REGULATORY AUTHORITY (KPPRA) Page 52
that complaints of bullying/harassment are dealt with internally and informally
wherever possible. This is likely to produce solutions which are speedy, effective
and minimise embarrassment.
8.3.2 Complaint Procedure- Formal Stage
Formal procedures will be necessary where the informal route proves ineffective,
for more serious instances of bullying/harassment and when an individual
chooses to go straight to the formal procedure as under:
 Within (15) business days of the alleged discriminatory incident, the
complainant, at his/her discretion, shall make a complaint to any one of
the following designated officials: Any KPPRA supervisor or department
head, the KPPRA Director HR/ Admin & Finance, the KPPRA MD.
 The complainant shall make contact with one of the above-designated
officials in order to properly bring forward a complaint.
 The complainant may use the KPPRA’s Discrimination Complaint Form
(HR#11) to file a complaint. Other formats such as memorandums,
handwritten statements, e-mail messages etc may also be acceptable. The
designated official shall convert verbal complaints into a written format as
soon as possible but no later than 2 days of the lodging of complaint. The
designated official will forward the complaint to the KPPRA Director HR/
Admin & Finance within (24) twenty-four hours of receipt. Complaints
that are submitted anonymously may not be accepted.
 An employee who believes that he/she is a victim of discrimination,
harassment and/or retaliation in the workplace has an affirmative duty to
report such conduct.
 Supervisors have a duty to pro-actively address workplace issues that deal
with discrimination and harassment. A supervisor who fails to take
appropriate action under this section will be subject to disciplinary action.
To the extent possible, the confidentiality of the person making the
complaint and that of the respondent will maintained.
KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA PUBLIC PROCUREMENT REGULATORY AUTHORITY (KPPRA) Page 53
 Information contained in the report of inquiry may be used in disciplinary
actions resulting from the investigation.
 Investigation Officer investigative reports are deemed confidential unless
otherwise directed by a competent court of jurisdiction or by order of the
MD.
 Therefore, the employee will be provided a summary of the investigation.
 Investigation documentation shall not be photocopied or disseminated
beyond the MD’s Office and Human Resource Department. “Relevant

summary of the findings.
 Within (5) five business days from the receipt of the complaint, an
individual designated by the MD, shall begin an investigation of the
complaint.
 KPPRA employees shall cooperate with an investigation and be truthful
with the investigator. Failure to cooperate and to be truthful may result in
disciplinary action.
 Within (25) forty five-business days from the beginning of the
investigation, the KPPRA investigating officer or designated individual,
shall submit a confidential written report of inquiry to the MD.
 The KPPRA Attorney or his/her designee shall have (14) fourteen business
days to review the report and to issue a written determination on whether
a discriminatory practice has occurred.
 Within (5) five-business days of receipt of the determination, the MD or
his/her designee shall review the determination and report. The MD will
forward the determination to the respondent’s department Director for
appropriate action, if necessary. Disciplinary action shall be consistent
with KPPRA policy and procedures. The MD shall forward a copy of the
determination, along with the report to the KPPRA investigating officer.

CHAPTER-9: GRIEVANCE RESOLUTION
9.1 Objective
The objective of this policy is to provide a method for employees to express any
grievance they may have and approach different levels of authority in the
organization to address the grievance.
9.2 Policy
The employee is first advised to try and settle the grievance with his/her
immediate supervisor. If, however this not possible or does not resolve the
grievance, then he/she should contract the next level up which is the department
Head or the Region Head. The supervisor or the departmental head then
attempts to resolve the grievance. If the above channels cannot resolve the
matter, the final step for the employee is to put his/her grievance in writing to
HRD. The HR department representative or Manager HR himself mediates in an
attempt to arrive at a satisfactory solution, and confirms any decision/proposed
action to the employee.
9.3 Grievances and Complaints
It is the policy of the KPPRA to treat all employees fairly in matters affecting their
employment. Every eligible employee shall have an opportunity to resolve
matters, which affect his/her employment. Every eligible employee with a
grievance shall have the right to present the grievance in accordance with the

immediate supervisor must make a good faith effort to resolve the issue
KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA PUBLIC PROCUREMENT REGULATORY AUTHORITY (KPPRA) Page 55
informally except in situations where a special hearing officer was appointed to
conduct the Appeal Hearing. A good faith effort shall consist of a face-to-face
meeting between the employee and his/her immediate supervisor to discuss the
issue and resolution. The filing of a formal, written grievance shall not preclude
continuing a good faith effort to resolve the grievance. The good faith effort does
not extend the time limit(s) included in the grievance procedure.
9.4.2 Formal Stage
 Within (7) seven business days following the event, on which the
grievance is based, an eligible employee may file a formal written
grievance with the Department Director.
 The grievance must be filed on forms developed by the Human Resource
Department. The grievance must be specific and refer to an issue that can
be acted upon. The contents of a formal written grievance and settlement
desired cannot be changed after it is submitted.

Department Director to the Director HR/ Admin & Finance and the
immediate supervisor of the employee.

Director or his/her designee shall provide a written response to the
employee who filed the grievance.

within (7) seven business days, the grievance will be automatically
appealed to the Head Office/MD.

the Chairperson will issue a decision as to whether the Appeals Committee will
accept the appeal for a hearing. The decision of the Chairperson or his/her
designee shall be based on the provisions outlined in this section. An affirmative
decision will allow the appeal to proceed. A denial will end the internal

CHAPTER-12: HEALTH, SAFETY & ENVIRONMENT
12.1 Introduction
In order to improve job satisfaction of the workforce, ensuring a safe and secure
environment for employees is always considered important for any organization.
To improve the safety and health conditions on an on-going basis, it is necessary
to continuously monitor the health and safety issues in the environment and
update the current procedures accordingly.
Commonsense and basic good housekeeping are the predominant factors
influencing the maintenance of high standards of health and safety in offices and
staff should always be conscious of dangers to themselves and their colleagues,
presented by their working environment and activities.
Any unsafe conditions, e.g. faulty lifts, faulty fire doors, missing fire extinguishers,
missing Fire Notices, defective equipment (particularly defective gas
connections), poor lighting, damaged floor coverings, unsafe furniture and so on,
should be reported at once to immediate supervisor, admin officer or safety

12.9 PROCEDURE
12.9.1 Fire Safety
Safety Officer for Head Office will be nominated by Director HR/ Admin &
Finance while safety officers for each premise will be nominated by Director HR/
Admin & Finance in-consultation with regional/ relevant area head. List of safety
officers will be maintained at Head Office and updated on annual basis or as and
when required.
12.9.2 General Fire Prevention
Fire is probably the most serious danger which most KPPRA personnel will ever
have to face. It can break out almost anywhere and can affect everyone. Two
types of fire can break out in the premises of the KPPRA 1) Electrical fire and 2)
general fire due to wooden items, paper and other combustible material.
Regular fire prevention routines are one of the simplest and most efficient means
of preventing fire. The value of the nightly routine of switching off and
unplugging electrical equipment (unless the equipment concerned is designed to
run continuously), checking that gas fires and gas taps are turned off, and closing
the doors to all rooms and staircase enclosures, cannot be over-stressed.
12.9.2.1 Fire Routine Procedure
[
Safety Officer must ensure that all members of staff are instructed in the action to
be taken should a fire break out. This is most conveniently done by giving each
member of staff written instructions in the form of a Fire Routine Procedure
which will be developed by safety officer under the guidance of Director HR/
Admin & Finance
KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA PUBLIC PROCUREMENT REGULATORY AUTHORITY (KPPRA) Page 85
12.9.2.2 On Discovering a Fire
If you discover a fire:
 Operate the nearest fire alarm. If no fire alarm is provided, shout "Fire".
 On hearing the fire alarm, calmly leave the building immediately by the
nearest available exit. If time permits without endangering your life,
secure important documents, cash, shut down system etc.
 Lifts must NOT be used. Help any injured, aged, disabled person to
evacuate the premises.
 Assemble at a safe place for headcount/attendance.
 Ensure that the emergency department such as fire brigade, police,
hospitals etc. has been informed of the location of the fire. Also inform
security officer about the incident.
12.9.2.3 Means of Escape (Fire Exits)
It is essential that the means of escape from a building should function efficiently.
Exit doors should be fastened so that they can be easily and immediately opened
from the inside without the use of keys. Exit routes must not be obstructed or
used as storage areas.
12.9.2.4 Fire Fighting Equipment
Generally, two to four types of fire extinguishers are provided in KPPRA
premises. Each has a specific range of use and each is located adjacent to the
related fire risk. The extinguishing media used are: water, carbon dioxide,
vaporizing liquid and dry powder. The external appearance of each type of
extinguisher maybe different and each carries its own instructions for use. In
certain buildings, hose reels are also provided. Fire blankets are provided in
many locations and should be used for smothering fires involving flammable
liquids or burning clothing.
KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA PUBLIC PROCUREMENT REGULATORY AUTHORITY (KPPRA) Page 86
KPPRA’s personnel are well advised to know the location of the firefighting
equipment in their area of work, to know on what type of fire each piece of
equipment can be used and how each should be used. Instructions for the use of
fire extinguishers can be obtained from the KPPRA Safety Officer.
Whenever firefighting equipment has been used, an immediate report must be
made to the Safety Officer, so that the equipment may be recharged or replaced.
12.9.2.5 Fire Fighting
In all buildings protection of human life must take priority over fighting fires. The
person discovering a fire must promptly initiate the emergency procedures listed
above, unless they are entirely confident that they can extinguish the fire
immediately, using an appropriate fire extinguisher, fire blanket, etc. Delay can
be fatal as, once a fire is out of control, it can spread rapidly and cut off escape
routes.
If possible, and without endangering personal safety, attempts can be made to
contain and control a fire until the Fire Brigade arrives. Make sure that you use
the correct type of fire extinguisher. The wrong choice can turn a minor incident
into a major event. Always remember to take a position between the fire and the
exit so that your escape route cannot be cut off. Be aware of what is happening in
the surrounding area and take account of your own limitations. If possible,
always make sure that someone else knows that you are tackling the fire.
12.9.2.6 After a Fire
[
Even if a fire appears to have been successfully extinguished it will still be
necessary to ask the Fire Brigade to check that the fire has not unknowingly
spread, and that materials or the building fabric cannot reignite.
Headcount of all the employees should be carried out by safety officer to
ascertain any missing personnel. For this purpose all employees should gather at
a nearby location (already identified by safety officer) and attendance should be
carried out to match with office attendance log.
KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA PUBLIC PROCUREMENT REGULATORY AUTHORITY (KPPRA) Page 87
Safety Officer must ensure that all fires within the building are recorded and
reported to the Head Office through proper channel.
12.9.2.7 Fire Drills
It is essential that the fire alarm system and a pre-arranged plan specific for the
evacuation of each building should be tested regularly. Safety Officer must ensure
that fire drills are held at each location, at least on half yearly basis.
As soon as you hear the fire alarm, prepare to evacuate the premises.
12.9.3 First Aid
12.9.3.1 First Aid General
The guidance given in this section is the simplest instruction in First Aid. If you
have not learned basic First Aid measures, or have not been trained in First Aid,
you must familiarize yourself with the name(s) and location(s) of your nearest
qualified First Aider(s)/ Safety Officer. It will be too late to try to find this
information once an accident has happened.
Notices giving the names, telephone numbers and locations of persons qualified
in First Aid and the location of the nearest First Aid equipment must be
prominently displayed in the building.
12.9.3.2 Principles of First Aid
First Aid is the skilled provision of treatment for a casualty or any person
suddenly taken ill, using the facilities and materials available at the time, to save
life and to prevent any deterioration in the condition of that person while
awaiting the arrival of qualified medical assistance (usually an ambulance). First
Aid boxes are provided in each area or building and these boxes should be placed
at a prominent place.
KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA PUBLIC PROCUREMENT REGULATORY AUTHORITY (KPPRA) Page 88
12.9.3.3 First Aid Immediate Action
If an accident occurs, you should do the following: -
Check your own safety! You are of no use if you become a second casualty. Use
protective clothing and equipment where necessary. Identify the cause, nature of
injury and respond accordingly. Casualties should be seated or reclined when
being treated, as appropriate.
 Keep calm - assess the situation - reassure the casualty
Speaking calmly to the casualty establishes consciousness and may provide
useful information about the accident and assist in eliminating continuing
danger. If immediate danger threatens, remove the casualty carefully to a safe
place without endangering yourself. If the person's clothing is on fire, roll the
casualty on the ground in a coat or fire blanket, etc.
Get help at once if the injuries appear serious by calling a qualified First Aider.
Delegate a person nearby to call an ambulance, if one is required.
[
12.9.3.4 First Aid First Priorities
a. Breathing & Heart Beating:
 If the casualty is not breathing, start mouth-to-mouth respiration at once
(see method below).
 If the casualty heart is not working, start CPR as per method below.
Remember, the first minutes are vital.
b. Bleeding:
 If bleeding is severe, apply firm direct pressure on the wound to stop the
bleeding, using hands, pads, dressings, etc. Maintain pressure until
professional help is available.
 If the bleeding is from a limb, elevate it 10" to 12" to reduce the blood flow.
KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA PUBLIC PROCUREMENT REGULATORY AUTHORITY (KPPRA) Page 89
 Do NOT use a tourniquet.
c. Trauma or Fluid Loss:
 Keep the casualty quiet, reassured and comfortable.
 Keep the casualty warm by a light covering but do not overheat.
 Do NOT give anything to eat or drink to the casualty as this may cause
complications if medical attention is required.
d. First Aid Electric Shock
 Do NOT touch the casualty until the current is switched off. If the current
cannot be switched off, stand on some dry insulating material and use a
wooden or plastic implement to free the casualty from the electrical
source.
 If breathing has stopped, start mouth-to-mouth respiration and continue
until the casualty starts to breathe or until medical help arrives.
e. Mouth-to-Mouth Respiration/CPR
CPR is most successful when administered as quickly as possible, but you must
first determine if it's necessary. It should only be performed when a person isn't
breathing or circulating blood adequately.
Quickly evaluate whether the person is responsive. Look for things like eye
opening, sounds from the mouth, or other signs of life like movement of the arms
and legs. In infants and younger children, rubbing the chest (over the
breastbone) can help determine if there is any level of responsiveness. In older
children and adults, this can also be done by gently shaking the shoulders and
asking if they're all right.
The next step is to check if the victim is breathing. You can determine this by
watching the person's chest for the rise and fall of breaths and listening for the
sound of air going in and out of the lungs. If you can't determine whether
KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA PUBLIC PROCUREMENT REGULATORY AUTHORITY (KPPRA) Page 90
someone is breathing, you should begin CPR as mentioned below and continue
until help arrives.
 Lay the casualty flat if possible.
 Ensure no obstructions are in the mouth (remove dentures, etc.).
 Ease constrictions at the neck, chest and waist.
 Place a rolled jacket or pad under the shoulders to arch the neck.
 Pinch the casualty’s nostrils and draw the chin forward to open the mouth.
 Take a moderately deep breath and breathe steadily into the casualty’s
mouth (chest will rise).
 Lift your own head and allow the casualty to exhale (see chest deflate).
 Repeat this cycle at a rate of 6 to 8 per minute.
 Continue until the casualty resumes breathing unaided or until qualified
medical services take over, however long this takes.
 In case casualty’s heart beat is stopped, you should give two rescue
breaths followed immediately by cycles of 30 chest compressions and 2
rescue breaths. This procedure involves pushing on the chest to help
circulate blood and maintain blood flow to major organs.
 If breathing resumes, place the casualty in the Open Airway (Recovery)
Position and treat as an unconscious casualty.
Open Airway (Recovery) Position
KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA PUBLIC PROCUREMENT REGULATORY AUTHORITY (KPPRA) Page 91
f. Burns and Scalds
Burns and scalds, however large or small and from whatever cause (including
chemicals) should be cooled by flushing with copious amounts of cold water for
at least 10 - 15 minutes (longer if necessary). The affected area should then be
covered with a dry sterile dressing.
Never apply any lotions, ointments or anything similar to a burn or scald. COLD
WATER ONLY.
Do NOT burst blisters or attempt to remove charred materials from a burn.
Always obtain medical attention.
g. Eyes
Foreign bodies (including chemicals) in the eye should be flushed out using clean
cool water for at least 10 - 15 minutes. Sterile eye wash bottles of the sealed cap
type may be used if tap water is not immediately available. Casualties with eye
injuries should always be sent to the hospital with the eye covered by a pad.
12.9.3.5 First Aid Box Requirement
First aid box with following minimum requirement should be provided at each
premise:
 Guidance Card: noting the most important emergency procedures.
 Wrapped Sterile Adhesive Dressings (Assorted sizes): for protecting
small cuts or other breaks in the skin.
 Sterile Eye Pads: sterile pad with a bandage attached to it to use over
the eye following eye injuries.
 Individually Wrapped Triangular Bandages (preferably sterile): can be
used as a pad to stop bleeding, as a sterile covering for large injuries
such as burns, as a bandage, or to make a sling.
 Safety Pins: may be necessary to secure bandages.
KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA PUBLIC PROCUREMENT REGULATORY AUTHORITY (KPPRA) Page 92
 Medium Wound Dressings: a sterile unmedicated dressing pad with a
bandage attached to it.
 Disposable Gloves: gloves to be worn at all times when dealing with
blood or body fluids.
 Plastic Disposable Bags: to be used for disposal. This waste should be
incinerated where possible, or sealed and disposed of in the normal
way.
Tablets or other medication must NOT be kept in the First Aid box. It is advisable
to have small boxes at various sites instead of one large one.
12.10 Risk Assessment
Risk assessment exercise will be carried out by Safety Officer prior to any work
activity to be undertaken. The assessment must be carried out in consultation
with those who will undertake the work. A written statement of the assessment
identifying any significant hazards must be completed and provided to those
undertaking the work. The assessment should describe the preventative and
protective measures required to avoid, eliminate, reduce or control the risks
identified to a tolerable level.
12.11 Conclusion
A safe and healthy environment in the KPPRA can only be possible if we
understand the importance of it and act together to make KPPRA a safer place to
work. Good housekeeping can prevent most of the accident from happening.

coming year.
The performance evaluation starts with employee’s own feedback on his/her
technical and professional achievements during the last performance period.

 Administrative Skills/Compliance
 Performance Objectives
The appraiser will be required to arrange a one-to-one discussion session with
the appraisee. The appraiser will discuss the appraisal form with the employee
and will explain reasons for the assigned rating. In case of any disagreement
